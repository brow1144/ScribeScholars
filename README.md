## Using the Repository
 
  ## Clone the repo to your github desktop from brow1144/ScribeScholars
   
  ### Once you have the repository set up, type "yarn" in the directoy to add all dependencies. After that you can type "yarn start" and it will open the development server.
  
  
   
   a. Once you have this setup you will be able to use git how you normally would on a personal project (branches, commits, pushes, etc.)
4. Before you start working on anything make sure you get up to date with the master branch. You can do this in Github Desktop by going to Branch->Merge Into Current Branch then choose that you want to merge with upstream master. Then make sure to click fetch origin to refresh your local files. 
    
    a. When you have a version of your repository you want to add to the main repository, 
        
        1. Go to github in your browser and click pull request, write a short description of what you are adding and then if you feel it is ready then commmit merge and it will be updated on the master branch.
